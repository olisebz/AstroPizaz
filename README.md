# ZMS-Pizza Frontend

Welcome to the ZMS-Pizza Frontend project! This is the frontend of our innovative pizza ordering platform developed as a school project. We have created a user-friendly application that allows users to quickly and easily order their favorite pizzas.

This project was developed using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: Structuring the web pages.
- **SCSS**: Advanced CSS features for styling.
- **JavaScript**: Functional programming and interactive features.
- **React.js**: JavaScript framework for building the user interface.

## Additional Technologies

In addition to the main technologies, we have used the following libraries:

- **Bootstrap**: For pre-built UI components and responsive design.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For a utility-first CSS framework and flexible customization.
